# _Tap Room_
#### _React with Reduxproject for Epicodus, 2020.09.11_
#### By _**Sara Kane**_

## Description
Keg inventory tracker for a bar using React with Redux.

## Specifications

* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
* As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
